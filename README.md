=========

Ths is the main repository for the Health Infrastructures Information app for DHIS2. 

## Installation

To install this app to a DHIS2 system, you need to download this repository as a .zip, clicking the button on the right.
When downloaded, DHIS2 will not recognize it as an app because all the files in the zip are inside a folder. 

To install it, you must decompress the file and enter to the project folder. Then, you must compress all the files again in a .zip, making sure there is no folder containing all the files again.

If you don't know how to install apps to DHIS2 read its official manual here:
https://www.dhis2.org/doc/snapshot/en/developer/html/ch02s04.html

If it's the first time you use the app, you will need to install its metadata to your DHIS2 system. To do it, make sure you have superuser permissions, then go to Settings and press "Install metadata" and the app will be ready to use.
