## Installation

To install this app to a DHIS2 system, you need to download this repository as a .zip, clicking the buton on the right.
When downloaded, DHIS2 will not recognize it as an app because all the files in the zip are inside a folder. 

To install it, you must decompress the file and enter to the project folder. Then, you must compress all the files again in a .zip, making sure there is no folder containing all the files again.

If you don't know how to install apps to DHIS2 read its official manual here:
